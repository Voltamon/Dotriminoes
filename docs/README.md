# Dotriminoes

## Description
This is a Dotriminoes game (you can also call it as a mini version of Tetris) written using the `raylib.h` library in C. Well, I have not tested the code yet for cross-platform. However, the `dotris.exe` file works fine on Windows

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [Disclaimer] This code is not completely bug free and can be made better. I am still learning C.

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/Voltamon/Dotriminoes.git
