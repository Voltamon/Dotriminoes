# Dotriminoes

## Description
This is a Dotriminoes game (you can also call it as a mini version of Tetris) written using the raylib.h library in C. Well, I have not tested the code yet for cross-platform. However, the dotris.exe file works fine on Windows

[Disclaimer] This code is not completely bug free and can be made better. I am still learning C.
